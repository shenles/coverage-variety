# Examining Coverage Variety in Pitchfork and Rolling Stone
In 2012, I noticed that influential music publication Pitchfork had at times attracted criticism for not making more of an effort to review a wider variety of artists and genres. To test if there was any basis to that criticism, I looked at all of Pitchfork's album reviews from 2011 (by doing some fairly straightforward web scraping with Python 2) and found out how many different artists were represented by those reviews, how many different genres were represented by those artists, and how many artists fell under each genre. I repeated that process for Rolling Stone, a comparably influential publication, to see how the two publications compared in terms of coverage variety.

In 2011, which publication reviewed a greater breadth of musicians and genres, relative to the number of reviews published?

## Results
In 2011, Pitchfork published 1166 album reviews, representing 1062 different artists and 158 different genres.
Rolling Stone published 456 album reviews, representing 402 different artists and 79 different genres.

91.08 percent of Pitchfork's reviewed albums in 2011 were by unique artists (not covered multiple times in one year), and there were repeats 8.92 percent of the time.
88.16 percent of Rolling Stone's reviewed albums were by unique artists, and there were repeats 11.84 percent of the time.

Pitchfork's biggest genre was indie, followed by electronic and hip-hop.
Rolling Stone's biggest genre was hip-hop, followed by indie and rock.

Overall, for album reviews published online in 2011, Pitchfork covered a greater variety of artists relative to the number of reviews it published, and Rolling Stone covered a greater variety of genres relative to the number of reviews it published.
